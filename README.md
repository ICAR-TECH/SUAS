## About These Tools

This suite brings together two complementary decision-support tools for seed-based scaling analysis. The heatmap tool focuses on three-year outcomes under different utilization efficiencies, while the trajectory tool explores year-wise growth paths and saturation behavior.

# TSH: Three-Year Seed-Utilization Heatmap

Three-year coverage outcomes under varying seed efficiencies. This tool simulates crop area expansion driven by seed production and utilization efficiency over three successive years. It generates a heatmap showing the percentage of total area covered after Year 3 under different seed utilization scenarios, helping to identify saturation thresholds, efficiency gaps, and optimal utilization pathways for planners and researchers.

# YGT: Year-wise Growth Trajectories

Dynamic trajectories of area coverage over time: This tool simulates year-wise expansion of cultivated area based on seed multiplication dynamics under varying utilization efficiencies. Starting from an initial CFLD seed source, it traces the growth of coverage over successive years, revealing the pace and saturation potential of varietal dissemination and informing long-term scaling projections for policy and extension interventions.
